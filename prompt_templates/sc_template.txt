Given the following text and a relational triplet extracted from it:

Text: {input_text}
Triplet: {query_triplet}

The relation '{query_relation}' in the triplet is defined as '{query_relation_definition}' In this context, is there any relation appropriate to replace it?

IMPORTANT: Consider relations as EQUIVALENT if they have the same semantic meaning, even if:
- They use different words or expressions (e.g., "reports on" vs "reports about")
- They are in different languages (e.g., English vs Japanese)
- They have slightly different phrasing but describe the same relationship

Please answer by providing only the letter of your choice.
